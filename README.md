# snakeGame_Demo

This is a demo video of my snakeGame project. The code can be shared upon request

### App platform
Ali Lakhani 20671281 a25lakha openjdk version "12.0.2" macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra (MacBook Pro 2018) 
This app was made on intelliJ using the javaFX library

### Objective
This application is a custom snakeGame. Rules proceed as regular can can be found on the main menu screen of the application. 

The game has the the ability to play, pause, and skip levels, using keyboard shortcuts:
Arrow keys: turn the snake in the direction indicated
P: pause and un-pause the game
R: reset to the splash screen
1: start level 1
2: start level 2
3: start level 3
Q: quit and display the high score screen

- As the levels increase the snake will move faster! 
- The first two levels are timed and once they are done you must press P to proceed in the game to the next level 
- The final level in un timed and so you can play until you die. 
- Your final score will be saved for future game plays and will be reset only on resetting the application, 

Enjoy!
